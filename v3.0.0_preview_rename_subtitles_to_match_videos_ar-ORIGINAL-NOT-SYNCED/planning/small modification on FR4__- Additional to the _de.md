# small modification on FR4:

- Additional to the "default" tag also it will apply the language tag found in the subtitle name (SubtitleName.{ar, en ..etc}.srt) if not found, it will apply the one configured in the config file (defaults to none).

Please update the PRD accordingly

Of course. That is a thoughtful and important clarification that adds intelligent behavior to the tool. The PRD has been updated with this final modification.[^1][^2]

I will now switch to the `pm` agent to present the final version of the document.

`agent pm`

Thank you for that final detail. It has been incorporated. This level of refinement ensures the development team builds the exact tool you envision.

Here is the final version of the PRD. This document is now considered complete and will be the definitive guide for our `architect` and `dev` agents.

## Product Requirements Document: Subtitle Renamer Tool [AR] - Subtitle Embedding Feature (Version 2.1)

* **Project Name**: Subtitle Renamer Tool [AR]
* **Feature**: Subtitle Embedding via `mkvmerge`
* **Version**: 2.1
* **Date**: October 2, 2025


### 1. Introduction \& Background

The "Subtitle Renamer Tool [AR]" is an existing, functional Python script that automates the process of renaming subtitle files to match their corresponding video files. It leverages intelligent pattern matching for episodes and movies and provides a seamless workflow through Windows context menu integration.

This document outlines the requirements for a major new feature: **the ability to embed subtitles directly into `.mkv` video files.** This new functionality will exist as a separate but complementary script, `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`, leveraging the power of the `mkvmerge` command-line tool.

### 2. Problem Statement

Users who have organized their subtitle files with the existing renamer tool still face the manual, time-consuming task of embedding those subtitles into their video files. This often involves opening a GUI application and processing files one by one. This manual process is inefficient, especially for users with large media libraries, and creates a disconnected experience between renaming and finalizing the media files.

The new feature will solve this by **automating the subtitle embedding process** for `.mkv` files in a single, batch operation, callable directly from the Windows context menu.

### 3. Goals \& Objectives

* **Automate Subtitle Embedding**: Create a script that automatically finds matching pairs of `.mkv` videos and subtitles and merges them.
* **Seamless User Experience**: Integrate the script into the Windows right-click context menu, providing a "one-click" solution for embedding subtitles within a folder.
* **Leverage Existing Logic**: Utilize the robust file and episode matching logic from the original `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` script to ensure consistency and accuracy.
* **Ensure No Data Loss**: The process will be non-destructive by creating backups of original files before generating new, merged video files.


### 4. Target Audience

The target users are existing and new users of the "Subtitle Renamer Tool [AR]" who manage local libraries of `.mkv` media files and want a permanent, all-in-one solution for their videos and subtitles.

### 5. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **FR1** | **New Script** | A new Python script named `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` will be created to house the embedding functionality. |
| **FR2** | **File Discovery \& Matching** | The script must scan the directory it's run from to identify all `.mkv` files and all subtitle files (e.g., `.srt`, `.ass`). It will then match video files to their corresponding subtitle files using the same episode/movie detection logic as the original renaming script. |
| **FR3** | **`mkvmerge` CLI Integration** | The script will execute command-line operations using `mkvmerge.exe` to perform the merge. The path to `mkvmerge.exe` will be configurable. However, if not configured, it will assume `mkvmerge.exe` is in the same directory as `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`. |
| **FR4** | **Embedding Logic** | For each matched pair, the script will generate and run a `mkvmerge` command. The command will mux (merge) the original video stream, all its original audio/subtitle tracks, and the new external subtitle file into a new output file. The muxed subtitle track will be tagged as "default" unless configured otherwise in the config file. **Additionally, the subtitle track language tag will be inferred from the subtitle filename (e.g., .{ar, en, fr} in the filename). If not found, it will fall back to the language configured in the config file (defaulting to none).** |
| **FR5** | **Output File Management** | The script will rename the original video files to `[Original_Filename].original.mkv` first. Then, to ensure no overwrites, it will generate new muxed video files with the original file names `[Original_Filename].mkv`. |
| **FR6** | **Batch Processing** | The script must be able to process all matched video-subtitle pairs within a folder in a single execution. |
| **FR7** | **Windows Context Menu** | A new registry file (`add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg`) will be created. When run, it will add an "Embed subtitles" command to the folder context menu in Windows File Explorer, which executes the `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` script and assumes both it and `mkvmerge.exe` reside in `C:\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\`. |
| **FR8** | **Configuration** | The script will use a `config.ini` file, similar to the existing tool. This file will allow users to configure: the path to `mkvmerge.exe`, the output filename pattern, and default subtitle track properties (e.g., language, `default track` flag). |
| **FR9** | **User Feedback and Reporting** | The script will provide clear, real-time feedback to the console, indicating which files are processed, the status of the merge operation (success/failure), and the final output filename. It will also support exporting an `embedding_report.csv`, building on the `export_analysis_to_csv` function from the renaming script. CSV export will be configurable (enable/disable) via the config file. |

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **NFR1** | **Dependency** | The feature requires `mkvmerge.exe` (part of the MKVToolNix suite) to be present on the user's system. The path to the executable must be correctly configured. |
| **NFR2** | **Platform** | The core script should be written in Python 3 for cross-platform compatibility. However, the context menu integration (`.reg` file) is specific to the Windows operating system. |
| **NFR3** | **Performance** | The script should handle directories with a large number of files efficiently, processing them in a reasonable amount of time. |
| **NFR4** | **Error Handling** | The script must gracefully handle errors, such as `mkvmerge.exe` not being found, permissions issues, or a failed merge operation, and report these errors to the user. |

### 7. Out of Scope

* Embedding subtitles into video formats other than `.mkv`.
* Providing a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Transcoding or re-compressing video or audio streams. The script will only perform stream copying (muxing).
* Removing or modifying existing tracks within the original `.mkv` file.

***

With this final PRD, we have a clear and comprehensive plan.

I am now returning to my role as the Orchestrator. We are ready to move on to the next phase. Let me know when you are ready to begin development.
