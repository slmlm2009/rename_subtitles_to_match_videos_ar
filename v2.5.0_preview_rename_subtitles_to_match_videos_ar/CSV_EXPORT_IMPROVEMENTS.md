# CSV Export Improvements - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented an improved CSV export format that is more user-friendly, provides comprehensive information, and is compatible with Excel/spreadsheet applications.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Added datetime Import
- Added `from datetime import datetime` to support timestamp generation

### 2. New Function Signature
**Old:** `def export_analysis_to_csv():`  
**New:** `def export_analysis_to_csv(renamed_count=0, movie_mode=False):`

### 3. Updated Main Flow
**Old:** Export before renaming  
**New:** Rename first, then export with results  
```python
renamed_count, movie_mode_detected = rename_subtitles_to_match_videos()
if CONFIG['enable_export']:
    export_analysis_to_csv(renamed_count, movie_mode_detected)
```

### 4. Enhanced rename_subtitles_to_match_videos()
- Now returns `(renamed_count, movie_mode_detected)`
- Tracks movie mode activation

## New CSV Format

### Section 1: Summary Header
```csv
# Subtitle Renaming Report
# Generated: 2025-10-01 05:42:37
# Directory: C:\Users\...\Test_Short_Config
# Configuration: language=ar, videos=mkv|mp4, subtitles=srt|ass, export=True
#
# SUMMARY:
# Total Videos: 3
# Total Subtitles: 3
# Renamed: 1/3 subtitles          ← Shows success rate!
# Unmatched Videos: 1
# Unmatched Subtitles: 0
# Unidentified Files: 2
# Movie Mode: No
#
```

### Section 2: File Analysis Table (Proper CSV)
```csv
Original Filename,Detected Episode,New Name,Action
Show.S01E01.mkv,S01E01,No Change,--
Show.S01E02.mkv,S01E02,No Change,--
Show.S01E02.mp4,S01E02,No Change,--
Show.S01E02.ar.ass,S01E02,Show.S01E02.ar.ass,RENAMED
Subs.01.srt,(UNIDENTIFIED),No Change,--      ← Clear labeling!
Subs.02.srt,(UNIDENTIFIED),No Change,--
```

### Section 3: Match Summary
```csv
#
# MATCHED EPISODES:
# S01E02 -> Video: Show.S01E02.mkv | Subtitle: Show.S01E02.ar.ass -> Show.S01E02.ar.ass
#
# MISSING MATCHES:
# S01E01 -> Has Video: Show.S01E01.mkv | Missing: Subtitle
#
# UNIDENTIFIED FILES:
# Subs.01.srt (no episode pattern detected)

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old Format
```
FILENAME.EXTENSION >> IDENTIFIED SEASON#EPISODE#
Movie.S01E01.ar.srt >> S01E01
Movie.S01E01.mkv >> S01E01
random.txt >> S(None)E(None)

FOUND AND RENAMED MATCHING SUBTITLE AND VIEDEO FILES FOR THESE EPISODES:
- S01E01
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Not proper CSV (uses ">>")
- ❌ No statistics
- ❌ No timestamp
- ❌ Typo: "VIEDEO"
- ❌ Unclear format

### New Format
```csv
# Subtitle Renaming Report
# Generated: 2025-10-01 05:42:37
# SUMMARY:
# Renamed: 1/3 subtitles
#
Original Filename,Detected Episode,New Name,Action
Show.S01E01.mkv,S01E01,No Change,--
random.txt,(UNIDENTIFIED),No Change,--
Subs.01.srt,S01E01,Show.S01E01.ar.srt,RENAMED
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Proper CSV format
- ✅ Clear statistics
- ✅ Timestamp included
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Excel-compatible

## Update: Original Filename Fix (2025-01-10)

### Issue Reported
CSV export was showing renamed filenames in the "Original Filename" column instead of the actual original names.

### Root Cause
CSV export was happening AFTER renaming, so the file list was captured post-renaming.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Capture original file lists** at the start of `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos()`:
   ```python
   original_video_files = video_files.copy()
   original_subtitle_files = subtitle_files.copy()
   rename_mapping = {}
   ```

2. **Track all renames** in `process_subtitles()`:
   ```python
   rename_mapping[subtitle] = new_name  # Added after each os.rename()
   ```

3. **Pass original data** to export:
   ```python
   renamed_count, movie_mode_detected, original_videos, original_subtitles, rename_map = rename_subtitles_to_match_videos()
   export_analysis_to_csv(renamed_count, movie_mode_detected, original_videos, original_subtitles, rename_map)
   ```

4. **Updated export function** to accept and use original file lists:
   ```python
   def export_analysis_to_csv(renamed_count=0, movie_mode=False, original_videos=None, original_subtitles=None, rename_map=None):
   ```

### Result
✅ **"Original Filename" column now shows actual original names**  
✅ **"New Name" column shows the renamed files**  
✅ **Action column correctly shows "RENAMED" for renamed files**

### Example Output (After Fix)
```csv
Original Filename,Detected Episode,New Name,Action
Subtitle.E01.srt,S01E01,MyShow.S01E01.ar.srt,RENAMED
Subtitle.E02.srt,S01E02,MyShow.S01E02.ar.srt,RENAMED
```

**Previously showed (Bug):**
```csv
Original Filename,Detected Episode,New Name,Action
MyShow.S01E01.ar.srt,S01E01,MyShow.S01E01.ar.srt,RENAMED  ← Wrong! Showing renamed name
```

---

**Status:** ✅ Original Filename Issue Resolved  
**Tested On:** Multiple scenarios (TV series, movies, unidentified files)

## Update: Unmatched Subtitles Calculation Fix (2025-01-10)

### Issue Reported
Summary statistics showed incorrect "Unmatched Subtitles" count. Example: 7/8 subtitles renamed, but showed "Unmatched Subtitles: 5" instead of 0.

### Root Cause
The calculation was checking if episode strings directly existed in `temp_video_dict.keys()`, which didn't account for episode standardization. This caused false positives.

**Buggy code (line 789):**
```python
unmatched_subtitles = len([s for s in subtitle_files 
    if get_episode_number(s) and get_episode_number(s) not in temp_video_dict.keys()])
```

### Solution Implemented
Changed to simple arithmetic calculation:

```python
# Calculate unmatched subtitles properly:
# Unmatched = subtitles with episodes that weren't renamed (excluding unidentified)
unidentified_subtitle_count = len([s for s in subtitle_files if not get_episode_number(s)])
unmatched_subtitles = total_subtitles - renamed_count - unidentified_subtitle_count
```

### Logic
- **Total Subtitles** = All subtitle files found
- **Renamed** = Successfully matched and renamed
- **Unidentified** = No episode pattern detected
- **Unmatched** = Total - Renamed - Unidentified

### Example
Given:
- Total Subtitles: 8
- Renamed: 7
- Unidentified: 1 (`subtitle 3.srt`)
- **Result:** 8 - 7 - 1 = **0 unmatched** ✅

**Before (Bug):**
```
# Renamed: 7/8 subtitles
# Unmatched Subtitles: 5  ← WRONG!
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
# Renamed: 7/8 subtitles
# Unmatched Subtitles: 0  ← CORRECT!
```

## Update: Improved Label Clarity (2025-01-10)

### Issue
Summary labels were confusing:
- "Unmatched Videos" - unclear what this means
- "Unmatched Subtitles" - ambiguous
- "Unidentified Files" - not specific enough

### Solution
Updated to more explicit labels and split unidentified files by type:

**Before (Confusing):**
```
# Unmatched Videos: 1
# Unmatched Subtitles: 0
# Unidentified Files: 2

UNIDENTIFIED FILES:
- ShowName-Final.mkv (no episode pattern detected)
- subtitle 3.srt (no episode pattern detected)
```

**After (Clear):**
```
# Videos Missing Subtitles: 1
# Subtitles Missing Videos: 0
# Videos Without Episode Pattern: 1
# Subtitles Without Episode Pattern: 1

FILES WITHOUT EPISODE PATTERN:
- ShowName-Final.mkv (no episode pattern detected)
- subtitle 3.srt (no episode pattern detected)
```

### Benefits
✅ **Immediately clear** what each number represents  
✅ **Self-documenting** - no need to guess meanings  
✅ **Actionable** - shows exactly what's missing  
✅ **Granular** - separate counts for videos vs subtitles without episodes  
✅ **Consistent** - header matches the summary labels

## Update: Fixed Subtitle Filename Display in MISSING MATCHES (2025-01-10)

### Issue
In the "MISSING MATCHES" section, video filenames were shown but subtitle filenames were not:

**Before (Inconsistent):**
```
# MISSING MATCHES:
# S01E11111 -> Has Video: ShowName-11111.mkv | Missing: Subtitle
# S01E150 -> Has Subtitle | Missing: Video  ← No filename shown!
```

### Solution
Built a `temp_subtitle_dict` to look up subtitle filenames by episode, similar to the existing `temp_video_dict`.

**After (Consistent):**
```
# MISSING MATCHES:
# S01E11111 -> Has Video: ShowName-11111.mkv | Missing: Subtitle
# S01E150 -> Has Subtitle: randomsub-150.srt | Missing: Video  ← Filename now shown!
# S01E99 -> Has Subtitle: CathMeIfYouCan-99.sub | Missing: Video
```

### Benefits
✅ **Consistent formatting** - Both "Has Video" and "Has Subtitle" now show filenames  
✅ **Complete information** - Easy to identify which subtitle file needs a video  
✅ **Better usability** - No need to cross-reference with the file table  

---

**Final Status:** ✅ All Issues Resolved  
**Tested On:** Multiple scenarios (TV series, movies, unidentified files, mixed scenarios)
