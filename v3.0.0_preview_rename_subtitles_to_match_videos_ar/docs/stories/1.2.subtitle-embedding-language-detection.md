# Story 1.2: Implement Subtitle Embedding Logic with Language Detection

## Status
DONE

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the script to embed subtitles into MKV files with correct language tags,
**so that** my media players can properly identify and display the subtitle tracks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The script generates correct mkvmerge commands to mux video, audio, and subtitle tracks
2. The new subtitle track is tagged as "default" unless configured otherwise
3. Language codes are extracted from subtitle filenames (e.g., `.ar.srt`, `.en.srt`, `.fr.srt`)
4. If no language code is found in the filename, the script falls back to a configured default language
5. If no default language is configured, no language tag is applied
6. The mkvmerge command preserves all original video and audio tracks without re-encoding
7. A single video-subtitle pair can be successfully merged into a new MKV file

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create `detect_language_from_filename()` function
  - [x] Parse subtitle filename for common language code patterns (`.ar.`, `.en.`, `.fr.`, etc.)
  - [x] Support 2-letter and 3-letter ISO 639 language codes
  - [x] If no language code found in filename, check config for `language` setting in [Embedding]
  - [x] Return language code or None if no language detected
  - [x] Add unit tests for various filename patterns

  - [x] Accept parameters: video_file, subtitle_file, output_file, config
  - [x] Build command structure: `mkvmerge -o [output] [video] [subtitle options]`
  - [x] Add `--default-track 0:yes` for subtitle track if config `default_track` is True
  - [x] Add `--language 0:[code]` for subtitle track if language detected
  - [x] Ensure video and audio tracks are copied without re-encoding (mkvmerge default behavior)
  - [x] Return command as list of strings for subprocess execution

- [x] Task 3: Implement single file pair embedding (AC: 7)
  - [x] Create `embed_subtitle_pair()` function to orchestrate single pair
  - [x] Accept parameters: video_path, subtitle_path, config
  - [x] Detect language from subtitle filename
  - [x] Generate output filename (same as original video)
  - [x] Build mkvmerge command using `build_mkvmerge_command()`
  - [x] Execute command using existing `run_command()` function
  - [x] Return success/failure status and error message if any

- [x] Task 4: Add validation for file pair inputs
  - [x] Verify video file exists and has `.mkv` extension
  - [x] Verify subtitle file exists and has valid subtitle extension (`.srt`, `.ass`, `.ssa`)
  - [x] Check file read permissions for both files
  - [x] Check write permissions for output directory
  - [x] Return clear error messages for validation failures

- [x] Task 5: Add comprehensive unit tests
  - [x] Test language detection with various filename patterns
  - [x] Test language detection fallback to config default
  - [x] Test language detection with no language (returns None)
  - [x] Test mkvmerge command generation with language tag
  - [x] Test mkvmerge command generation without language tag
  - [x] Test mkvmerge command generation with default_track flag
  - [x] Test mkvmerge command generation with default_track=False
  - [x] Mock subprocess execution for integration test

- [x] Task 6: Add integration test with real mkvmerge
  - [x] Create test MKV file and subtitle file (demo.mkv and demo.ar.srt in tests/)
  - [x] Run actual mkvmerge command
  - [x] Verify output file is created
  - [x] Use `mkvmerge --identify` to verify subtitle track properties
  - [x] Clean up test files after test
  - Note: Integration test PASSED - verified subtitle track embedded successfully

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Previous Story

**Story 1.1 Implementation:**
- ✅ Base script structure created with modular functions
- ✅ Configuration loading from `config.ini` [Embedding] section
- ✅ mkvmerge validation and version detection working
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing implemented
- ✅ `run_command()` function ready for executing subprocess commands
- ✅ Stub function `build_mkvmerge_command()` ready to be implemented

**Configuration Available:**
- `config['mkvmerge_path']`: Path to mkvmerge.exe (or None for script directory)
- `config['default_track']`: Boolean - whether subtitle should be marked as default
- `config['language']`: Default language code (or None)

[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]

### Language Detection Strategy

**Strategy Pattern Implementation:**
The language detection follows a two-step strategy pattern as defined in the architecture:
1. **Primary Strategy**: Extract language code from subtitle filename
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Use configured default language from config.ini

**Common Language Code Patterns in Filenames:**
- `.ar.srt` → Arabic
- `.en.srt` → English
- `.fr.srt` → French
- `.ara.srt` → Arabic (3-letter code)
- `.eng.srt` → English (3-letter code)
- `Episode.01.ar.srt` → Arabic
- `Episode.01.Arabic.srt` → Full language name (should normalize to 'ar')

**ISO 639 Language Codes:**
Support both 2-letter (ISO 639-1) and 3-letter (ISO 639-2) codes. mkvmerge accepts both formats.

### mkvmerge Command Structure

**Windows Subprocess Pattern:**

For Windows CMD compatibility, always use list-based subprocess arguments:

```python
# Build command as list for subprocess.run()
command = [
    str(mkvmerge_path),           # Resolved path to mkvmerge.exe
    '-o', str(output_file),       # Output file
    str(video_file),              # Input video
    '--language', '0:ar',         # Subtitle language
    '--default-track', '0:yes',   # Mark as default
    str(subtitle_file)            # Subtitle file
]

# Execute with subprocess
result = subprocess.run(
    command,
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=300
)
```

**Subtitle Track Options (as list elements):**
- `['--language', '0:ar']` - Set language for first subtitle track
- `['--track-name', '0:Subtitle Name']` - Set friendly name
- `['--default-track', '0:yes']` - Mark as default
- `['--default-track', '0:no']` - Do not mark as default

**Important Notes:**
- mkvmerge by default copies video and audio streams without re-encoding
- Track numbering for subtitle options starts at 0 (first subtitle track added)
- All file paths must be converted to strings with `str()`
- Use resolved absolute paths to avoid ambiguity

**Conceptual Command Representation:**
```
mkvmerge.exe -o "output.mkv" "video.mkv" --language 0:ar --default-track 0:yes "subtitle.ar.srt"
```
(This shows the logical command structure, but implementation uses list format shown above)

### File Naming and Output

**Output File Strategy:**
- Output file should have the same name as the original video
- This story does NOT handle backup/renaming (that will be in Story 2.2)
- For now, use a temporary output name to avoid conflicts

**For This Story:**
Use output filename pattern: `{video_stem}.embedded.mkv` for testing purposes. Story 2.2 will handle proper backup and naming.

### Error Handling Considerations

**Validation Before Processing:**
- Verify input files exist and are readable
- Check output directory is writable
- Validate file extensions (`.mkv` for video, `.srt/.ass/.ssa` for subtitles)

**mkvmerge Execution:**
- Use existing `run_command()` function with 5-minute timeout
- Check subprocess return code (0 = success)
- Capture and return stderr for error messages
- Handle common mkvmerge errors (invalid file format, corrupted file, insufficient permissions)

[Source: architecture/architecture-document-subtitle-renamer-tool-ar-subtitle-embedding-feature.md#1.3-architectural-and-design-patterns]

### Component Integration

**`build_mkvmerge_command()` Function Signature:**
```python
def build_mkvmerge_command(video_file, subtitle_file, output_file, config):
    """
    Build mkvmerge command line for embedding subtitle into video.
    
    Args:
        video_file (str or Path): Path to source MKV video file
        subtitle_file (str or Path): Path to subtitle file to embed
        output_file (str or Path): Path for output merged file
        config (dict): Configuration dictionary from load_config()
    
    Returns:
        list: Command line arguments for subprocess.run()
    """
```

**Integration with Story 1.1 Components:**
- Use `validate_mkvmerge()` to get mkvmerge executable path
- Use `run_command()` to execute generated command
- Use `config` dictionary for settings (default_track, language)

**Windows Subprocess Execution Pattern:**

```python
def build_mkvmerge_command(video_file, subtitle_file, output_file, config):
    """
    Build mkvmerge command line for embedding subtitle into video.
    
    Returns command as list for Windows-compatible subprocess execution.
    """
    # Get validated mkvmerge path from Story 1.1
    success, mkvmerge_path, _ = validate_mkvmerge(config['mkvmerge_path'])
    
    # Build command as list
    command = [
        str(mkvmerge_path),
        '-o', str(output_file),
        str(video_file)
    ]
    
    # Add subtitle options
    language = detect_language_from_filename(subtitle_file) or config.get('language')
    if language:
        command.extend(['--language', f'0:{language}'])
    
    if config.get('default_track', True):
        command.extend(['--default-track', '0:yes'])
    
    command.append(str(subtitle_file))
    
    return command
```

**Execution:**
```python
command = build_mkvmerge_command(video_file, subtitle_file, output_file, config)
success, stdout, stderr = run_command(command)  # Uses existing run_command() from 1.1
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Mocked):**
- Test language detection logic with various filename patterns
- Test command building with different configuration options
- Mock subprocess calls to test command structure

**Integration Tests (Real mkvmerge):**
- Create small test MKV file (can use `ffmpeg` or provide fixture)
- Create test SRT file with sample subtitle
- Execute actual mkvmerge command
- Verify output file properties using `mkvmerge --identify`

**Test File Locations:**
- Test fixtures: `test_fixtures/` directory (create if needed)
- Small test video: ~100KB is sufficient
- Test subtitle: Simple SRT with 2-3 subtitle entries

### Success Criteria

This story is complete when:
1. ✅ Language detection works for common filename patterns
2. ✅ Language fallback to config works
3. ✅ mkvmerge commands are properly constructed
4. ✅ Single video-subtitle pair can be merged successfully
5. ✅ Output file contains subtitle track with correct language tag
6. ✅ Output file has subtitle marked as default (if configured)
7. ✅ All unit tests pass
8. ✅ Integration test with real mkvmerge passes
