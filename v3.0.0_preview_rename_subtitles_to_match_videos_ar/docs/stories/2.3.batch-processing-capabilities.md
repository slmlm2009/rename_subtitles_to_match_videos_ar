# Story 2.3: Add Batch Processing Capabilities

## Status
DONE

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to process all matched video-subtitle pairs in a folder with a single command,  
**so that** I can efficiently embed subtitles for my entire media library.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All matched pairs in the directory are processed in a single execution
2. Processing occurs sequentially to avoid resource contention
3. Progress is displayed for each file being processed (e.g., "Processing file 3 of 15...")
4. Users can see which file is currently being processed
5. The total processing time is displayed at the end
6. A summary shows: total files found, successfully processed, and failed operations
7. Failed operations don't stop processing of remaining files

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Context from Previous Stories

**Story 2.1 Completion:**
- ✅ `find_matching_files(directory)` returns list of `(video_path, subtitle_path)` tuples
- ✅ Episode and movie pattern matching working correctly
- ✅ Unmatched files are reported to user
- ✅ Integration test confirms matching logic works

**Story 2.2 Completion:**
- ✅ `embed_subtitle_pair(video, subtitle, working_dir)` handles complete embedding workflow
- ✅ Creates `.embedded.mkv` temporary files
- ✅ Backup management with `backups/` directory
- ✅ Intelligent collision handling for re-runs
- ✅ Disk space checking before operations
- ✅ Safe cleanup on failures
- ✅ All file management is atomic and safe

**Story 1.3 Completion (Base Batch Processing):**
- ✅ Main loop iterates through matched pairs
- ✅ Basic error handling with try-except
- ✅ Exit code handling (0 for full success, 1 for any failures)
- ✅ Basic success/failure tracking exists

**Current State:**
The main() function already has a basic batch processing loop from Story 1.3. This story enhances it with progress tracking, better reporting, and improved error handling.

[Source: Stories 1.3, 2.1, 2.2 Dev Agent Records]

### Batch Processing Architecture

**Current Main Loop (from Story 1.3):**
```python
def main():
    # ... configuration and validation ...
    
    matched_pairs = find_matching_files(directory_path)  # Story 2.1
    
    if not matched_pairs:
        print("No matched video-subtitle pairs found.")
        return 0
    
    # Basic loop - needs enhancement for this story
    for video_file, subtitle_file in matched_pairs:
        try:
            embed_subtitle_pair(video_file, subtitle_file, directory_path)  # Story 2.2
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing {video_file}: {e}")
            # Currently no proper tracking or recovery
    
    return 0  # Exit code handling needs improvement
```

**Enhanced Main Loop (This Story):**
```python
def main():
    # ... configuration and validation ...
    
    matched_pairs = find_matching_files(directory_path)
    
    if not matched_pairs:
        print("No matched video-subtitle pairs found.")
        return 0
    
    # Initialize tracking
    total_pairs = len(matched_pairs)
    successful_count = 0
    failed_count = 0
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Enhanced sequential processing loop
    for index, (video_file, subtitle_file) in enumerate(matched_pairs, start=1):
        # Display progress
        display_batch_progress(index, total_pairs, video_file.name)
        
        try:
            embed_subtitle_pair(video_file, subtitle_file, directory_path)
            successful_count += 1
            print(f"[SUCCESS] Completed: {video_file.name}")
        except Exception as e:
            failed_count += 1
            print(f"[ERROR] Failed to process pair: {video_file.name} + {subtitle_file.name}")
            print(f"Error details: {str(e)}")
            # Continue to next pair - don't stop batch processing
    
    # Calculate total time
    total_duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Display comprehensive summary
    display_batch_summary(total_pairs, successful_count, failed_count, total_duration)
    
    # Return appropriate exit code
    return 0 if failed_count == 0 else 1
```

### Progress Display Implementation

**Progress Format:**
- `[current/total] (percentage%) Processing: filename...`
- Example: `[3/15] (20%) Processing: Show.S01E03.mkv...`

**Implementation Details:**
```python
def display_batch_progress(current: int, total: int, filename: str) -> None:
    """
    Display progress for current file in batch processing.
    
    Args:
        current: Current file number (1-indexed)
        total: Total number of files to process
        filename: Name of the file being processed
    """
    percentage = int((current / total) * 100)
    print(f"\n[{current}/{total}] ({percentage}%) Processing: {filename}...")
    print("-" * 60)  # Visual separator
```

**Windows Console Compatibility:**
- Use standard print() - compatible with all Windows terminals
- Avoid ANSI color codes (not universally supported on Windows)
- Use flush=True if output buffering causes issues

[Source: docs/architecture/architecture-document-subtitle-renamer-tool-ar-subtitle-embedding-feature.md#Section 2.1 Windows Guidelines]

### Duration Formatting

**Human-Readable Time Formats:**
- < 60 seconds: `"45s"`
- 60-3599 seconds: `"2m 35s"`
- ≥ 3600 seconds: `"1h 15m 30s"`

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
def format_duration(seconds: float) -> str:
    """
    Convert seconds to human-readable duration format.
    
    Args:
        seconds: Duration in seconds
        
    Returns:
        Formatted string (e.g., "2m 35s", "1h 15m 30s")
    """
    if seconds < 60:
        return f"{int(seconds)}s"
    elif seconds < 3600:
        minutes = int(seconds // 60)
        remaining_seconds = int(seconds % 60)
        return f"{minutes}m {remaining_seconds}s"
    else:
        hours = int(seconds // 3600)
        minutes = int((seconds % 3600) // 60)
        remaining_seconds = int(seconds % 60)
        return f"{hours}h {minutes}m {remaining_seconds}s"
```

### Batch Summary Display

**Summary Format:**
```
=== BATCH PROCESSING COMPLETE ===
Total pairs found: 15
Successfully processed: 13
Failed operations: 2
Success rate: 86.7%
Total time: 5m 23s
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def display_batch_summary(total: int, successful: int, failed: int, duration: float) -> None:
    """
    Display comprehensive summary after batch processing.
    
    Args:
        total: Total number of pairs found
        successful: Number of successful operations
        failed: Number of failed operations
        duration: Total processing time in seconds
    """
    success_rate = (successful / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0
    formatted_time = format_duration(duration)
    
    print("\n" + "=" * 40)
    print("=== BATCH PROCESSING COMPLETE ===")
    print("=" * 40)
    print(f"Total pairs found: {total}")
    print(f"Successfully processed: {successful}")
    print(f"Failed operations: {failed}")
    print(f"Success rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    print(f"Total time: {formatted_time}")
    print("=" * 40)
```

### Error Recovery Strategy

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Individual file failures don't stop batch processing
- Each failure is logged with full error details
- Failed files are counted and reported in summary
- Exit code reflects overall batch success/failure

**Exception Handling:**
```python
# In main loop
try:
    embed_subtitle_pair(video_file, subtitle_file, directory_path)
    successful_count += 1
    print(f"[SUCCESS] Completed: {video_file.name}")
except Exception as e:
    failed_count += 1
    print(f"[ERROR] Failed to process pair: {video_file.name} + {subtitle_file.name}")
    print(f"Error details: {str(e)}")
    # Optionally log full traceback for debugging
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
    # Continue to next pair
```

**Why Sequential Processing (AC: 2):**
- MKVMerge is CPU and I/O intensive
- Parallel processing would cause resource contention
- Sequential ensures predictable performance
- Allows user to monitor progress file-by-file
- Windows subprocess management is simpler with sequential execution

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing Focus:**
- Progress display formatting (verify output format)
- Duration formatting (all time ranges: seconds, minutes, hours)
- Summary display formatting (100% success, partial failures, 100% failure)

**Integration Testing:**
- Complete batch workflow with 3+ file pairs
- Verify progress updates appear for each file
- Verify summary statistics are accurate
- Test error recovery: one file fails, others succeed
- Verify exit code: 0 for all success, 1 for any failures

**Test File Organization:**
```

├── test_batch_processing.py       # New for this story
│   ├── test_display_batch_progress_format
│   ├── test_format_duration_seconds
│   ├── test_format_duration_minutes
│   ├── test_format_duration_hours
│   ├── test_display_batch_summary_all_success

└── test_embed_subtitles_integration.py  # Extend existing
    ├── test_batch_processing_complete_workflow
    └── test_batch_processing_continues_after_failure
```

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run all unit tests
python -m unittest tests/test_batch_processing.py

# Run all integration tests
python -m unittest tests/test_embed_subtitles_integration.py

# Run complete test suite
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### Integration with Existing Code

**Files to Modify:**
- `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`:
  - Add 3 new functions: `display_batch_progress()`, `format_duration()`, `display_batch_summary()`
  - Enhance `main()` function with tracking and reporting
  - Update imports: add `import time`

**Files to Create:**
- `tests/test_batch_processing.py`: New unit test file for batch processing functions

**Files to Extend:**
- `tests/test_embed_subtitles_integration.py`: Add 2 new integration tests

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing functions remain unchanged
- Only `main()` is enhanced (additive changes)
- Backward compatible with existing behavior
