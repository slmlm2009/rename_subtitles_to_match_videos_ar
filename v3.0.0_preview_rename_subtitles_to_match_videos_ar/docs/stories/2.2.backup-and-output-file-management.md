# Story 2.2: Implement Backup and Output File Management

## Status
DONE

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** the script to create embedded videos with temporary names, then safely move originals to a `backups/` directory after successful merge,  
**so that** I don't lose any data and my working directory only contains the final embedded videos.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The embedded file is created with temporary name `[Original_Filename].embedded.mkv`
2. If merge succeeds, a `backups/` directory is created if it doesn't exist
3. Original `[Original_Filename].mkv` is moved to `backups/[Original_Filename].mkv`
4. Original subtitle file is moved to `backups/[Subtitle_Filename].[ext]` (ext = srt/ass/ssa)
5. The temporary `.embedded.mkv` file is renamed to `[Original_Filename].mkv`
6. If merge fails, the temporary `.embedded.mkv` file is deleted and originals remain untouched
7. Sufficient disk space is checked before starting the merge operation
8. Backup collision handling is intelligent:
   - If video already exists in `backups/`: skip video backup
   - If subtitle already exists in `backups/`: skip subtitle backup
   - Each file is checked independently
   - Subtitle is only deleted from working directory if it exists in `backups/`
   - A warning is logged for each skipped backup
9. Users can restore originals from `backups/` directory if needed

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context from Previous Story

Story 2.1 implemented file discovery and matching:
- `find_matching_files(directory_path)` returns list of (video, subtitle) pairs
- Episode and movie detection patterns working correctly
- Integration test confirmed batch processing works with current implementation

### File Management Strategy

**Embedding Workflow:**

```python
# High-level workflow
def process_single_pair(video_file, subtitle_file):
    1. Check disk space (video file size + subtitle size + 10% overhead)
    2. Create embedded file: video.mkv + subtitle.srt → video.embedded.mkv
    3. Verify mkvmerge succeeded (returncode == 0)
    4. On success:
       a. Create backups/ directory if doesn't exist
       b. Check if video.mkv already in backups/ - skip if exists, log warning
       c. Check if subtitle.srt already in backups/ - skip if exists, log warning
       d. Move video.mkv → backups/video.mkv (if not already backed up)
       e. Move subtitle.srt → backups/subtitle.srt (if not already backed up)
       f. Delete subtitle from working dir (ONLY if confirmed in backups/)
       g. Rename video.embedded.mkv → video.mkv
    5. On failure:
       a. Delete video.embedded.mkv (cleanup temp file)
       b. Log error
       c. Originals remain untouched
```

**Disk Space Check:**
- Required space = video file size + subtitle file size + 10% overhead
- Use `shutil.disk_usage()` to check available space
- Fail early if insufficient space before any file operations

**Output Naming:**
- Temporary: `{basename}.embedded{extension}`
- Example: `Show.S01E01.mkv` → `Show.S01E01.embedded.mkv` (temp)
- Final: `Show.S01E01.embedded.mkv` → `Show.S01E01.mkv` (after backup)

**Collision Handling (Backups):**
- If `backups/video.mkv` OR `backups/subtitle.srt` already exist:
  - Log: "Backup already exists for [filename] - skipping backup, updating working file"
  - Skip moving files that are already backed up (already safe)
  - Each file checked independently
  - Subtitle only deleted if confirmed to exist in backups/
  - Rename `video.embedded.mkv` → `video.mkv` (overwrite original with new embedded version)
  - Continue to next file
- **Rationale:** Existing backup means we're safe to overwrite original. Allows re-processing files if needed.

### Configuration Integration

**Config.ini Structure (from existing script):**

```ini
[General]
enable_export = true
language_suffix = ar

[Embedding]
# New section for this story
backup_suffix = original
overwrite_backups = prompt  # Options: prompt, always, never
```

**Implementation:**
- Extend existing `load_configuration()` from Story 1.1
- Add `[Embedding]` section parsing
- Default values: backup_suffix='original', overwrite_backups='prompt'

### File Operations

**Windows Path Handling (Critical):**
- Use `pathlib.Path` for all file operations
- Convert to `str()` only when calling subprocess
- Handles spaces and special characters correctly

**File Management Functions:**
```python
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

def ensure_backups_directory(working_dir: Path) -> Path:
    """
    Create backups/ directory if it doesn't exist.
    
    Returns: Path to backups directory
    """
    backups_dir = working_dir / 'backups'
    backups_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    return backups_dir

def backup_originals(video_file: Path, subtitle_file: Path, backups_dir: Path) -> tuple[bool, bool]:
    """
    Intelligently backup original files to backups directory.
    
    Returns: 
        tuple[bool, bool]: (video_backed_up, subtitle_backed_up)
        - True if file was backed up in this operation
        - False if file already exists in backups (skipped)
    Raises: OSError on filesystem errors
    """
    video_backup = backups_dir / video_file.name
    subtitle_backup = backups_dir / subtitle_file.name
    
    video_backed_up = False
    subtitle_backed_up = False
    
    # Check and backup video if needed
    if video_backup.exists():
        print(f"[INFO] Video backup already exists: {video_file.name}")
    else:
        shutil.move(str(video_file), str(video_backup))
        video_backed_up = True
        print(f"[BACKUP] Moved {video_file.name} → backups/")
    
    # Check and backup subtitle if needed
    if subtitle_backup.exists():
        print(f"[INFO] Subtitle backup already exists: {subtitle_file.name}")
    else:
        shutil.move(str(subtitle_file), str(subtitle_backup))
        subtitle_backed_up = True
        print(f"[BACKUP] Moved {subtitle_file.name} → backups/")
    
    return video_backed_up, subtitle_backed_up

def safe_delete_subtitle(subtitle_file: Path, backups_dir: Path):
    """
    Delete subtitle from working directory ONLY if it exists in backups.
    
    Safety check: Prevents data loss if backup failed silently.
    """
    subtitle_backup = backups_dir / subtitle_file.name
    
    if subtitle_backup.exists() and subtitle_file.exists():
        subtitle_file.unlink()
        print(f"[CLEANUP] Removed subtitle from working dir: {subtitle_file.name}")
    elif not subtitle_backup.exists():
        print(f"[WARNING] Subtitle not in backups/ - keeping in working dir: {subtitle_file.name}")

def rename_embedded_to_final(embedded_file: Path, final_name: Path):
    """Rename .embedded.mkv to final .mkv filename (overwrites if exists)."""
    embedded_file.rename(final_name)

def cleanup_failed_merge(embedded_file: Path):
    """
    Delete temporary .embedded.mkv file after merge failure.
    Original files remain untouched.
    """
    if embedded_file.exists():
        embedded_file.unlink()
        print(f"[CLEANUP] Removed temporary file: {embedded_file.name}")
```

### Integration with Existing Code

**Modify `embed_subtitle_batch()` from Story 1.3:**

```python
# Current implementation (simplified):
def embed_subtitle_batch(video_subtitle_pairs):
    for video, subtitle in pairs:
        output = video  # Currently overwrites original
        run_mkvmerge(output, video, subtitle)

# New implementation for Story 2.2:
def embed_subtitle_batch(video_subtitle_pairs, working_dir):
    backups_dir = None  # Created on first successful merge
    
    for video, subtitle in pairs:
        embedded_file = video.with_stem(f"{video.stem}.embedded")
        
        try:
            # Check disk space
            if not has_sufficient_space(video, subtitle):
                log_error(f"Insufficient disk space for {video.name}")
                continue
            
            # Create embedded file (temporary name)
            result = run_mkvmerge(embedded_file, video, subtitle)
            
            if result.returncode != 0:
                # Merge failed - cleanup and continue
                cleanup_failed_merge(embedded_file)
                log_error(f"Merge failed for {video.name}")
                continue
            
            # Merge succeeded - create backups directory on first success
            if backups_dir is None:
                backups_dir = ensure_backups_directory(working_dir)
            
            # Intelligently backup originals (checks each file independently)
            video_backed_up, subtitle_backed_up = backup_originals(video, subtitle, backups_dir)
            
            # Only delete subtitle if it's safely in backups/
            safe_delete_subtitle(subtitle, backups_dir)
            
            # Rename embedded file to original name (overwrites original video)
            rename_embedded_to_final(embedded_file, video)
            log_success(f"Successfully embedded: {video.name}")
                
        except Exception as e:
            # Ensure temp file cleanup on any error
            cleanup_failed_merge(embedded_file)
            log_error(f"Error processing {video.name}: {e}")
```

### Error Handling Strategy

**Error Types:**
1. **Disk Space Error**: Check before any operations, skip file if insufficient
2. **Backup Collision**: Skip already-backed-up files, log info message
3. **Move Error**: OS permission issues, log and skip
4. **Merge Failure**: Delete temp `.embedded.mkv` file, log failure, originals untouched
5. **Subtitle Deletion Safety**: Only delete if confirmed in backups/, otherwise keep and warn

**Logging:**
- Use existing console output pattern from Story 2.1
- Clear status messages: "Creating backups/...", "Moved to backups/...", "Embedding subtitles...", "Removed temporary file"
- Error messages with actionable guidance

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** (create new file `test_backup_management.py`):

```python

    def test_safe_delete_subtitle_in_backups(self):
        """Subtitle deleted only if confirmed in backups/"""
        # Create subtitle in both backups/ and working dir
        # Call safe_delete_subtitle()
        # Verify working dir subtitle deleted
        # Verify backups/ subtitle remains
    
    def test_safe_delete_subtitle_not_in_backups(self):
        """Subtitle kept if not in backups/"""
        # Create subtitle only in working dir
        # Call safe_delete_subtitle()

        # Verify .embedded.mkv deleted
    
    def test_disk_space_check_sufficient(self):
        """Processing continues with sufficient space"""
        # Mock disk_usage to return large value
        # Verify has_sufficient_space returns True
    
    def test_disk_space_check_insufficient(self):
        """Processing skips file with insufficient space"""
        # Mock disk_usage to return small value

- Verify original subtitle files moved to `backups/`
- Verify new `.mkv` files exist in working directory with same names
- Verify subtitles removed from working directory
- Test backup skip behavior when re-running on same files
- Simulate mkvmerge failure and verify temp file cleanup

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`:
  - Add `ensure_backups_directory()` function
  - Add `backup_originals()` function
  - Add `safe_delete_subtitle()` function
  - Add `rename_embedded_to_final()` function
  - Add `cleanup_failed_merge()` function
  - Add `has_sufficient_space()` function
  - Modify `embed_subtitle_batch()` to use new backup workflow
  - Update `load_configuration()` to parse `[Embedding]` section (optional for future)

**Files to Create:**
- `test_backup_management.py` (new unit test file)

**Config File:**
- Update `config.ini` with `[Embedding]` section (document in code comments)

[Source: docs/architecture/architecture-document-subtitle-renamer-tool-ar-subtitle-embedding-feature.md#source-tree]

### Dependencies

**Python Modules:**
- `pathlib.Path` - File path operations (already in use)
- `shutil.disk_usage()` - Disk space checking (standard library)
- `os.rename()` or `Path.rename()` - File renaming (already in use)

**External Tools:**
- None (this story only adds file management, mkvmerge already integrated)

[Source: docs/architecture/architecture-document-subtitle-renamer-tool-ar-subtitle-embedding-feature.md#tech-stack]

### Performance Considerations

**Disk Space Check:**
- Check once before processing each file (not before entire batch)
- Minimal overhead (~1ms per check)

**File Rename:**
- Atomic operation on same filesystem
- Nearly instantaneous (<10ms)
- No data copying involved

**Backup Storage:**
- Original video files remain on disk until user manually deletes
- User responsibility to clean up after verification

## Testing

### Test Strategy

**Unit Testing Focus:**
- Disk space checking logic (sufficient/insufficient cases)
- Backup creation (new file, collision accept, collision decline)
- Backup restoration (success case)
- Configuration parsing ([Embedding] section)

**Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end backup workflow with real temp files
- Verify `.original.mkv` files created
- Verify new `.mkv` files created after successful merge
- Simulate mkvmerge failure and verify backup restoration

**Manual Testing:**
- Test with actual media files in controlled environment
- Verify user prompts display correctly
- Verify manual cleanup of .original files works as expected

### Test Files Location

- Unit tests: `test_backup_management.py`
- Integration tests: extend `test_embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`
- Test data: Use `tests/` directory with temp file creation

### Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass (100% coverage of new functions)
- Integration test confirms backup workflow in batch processing
- Manual verification: .original files present, new files embedded correctly
- Error cases handled gracefully (insufficient space, backup collision, merge failure)
