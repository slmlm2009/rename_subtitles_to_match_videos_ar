# Story 1.3: Add Error Handling and Validation

## Status
DONE

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the script to gracefully handle errors and provide clear feedback,
**so that** I can understand what went wrong and take corrective action.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The script validates that `mkvmerge.exe` exists before attempting any operations
2. Clear error messages are displayed if `mkvmerge.exe` is not found
3. The script checks file permissions before attempting to read/write files
4. Failed mkvmerge operations are caught and reported with the specific error
5. Partial failures during batch processing don't stop the entire operation
6. Each error includes the affected filename and a description of the problem
7. A summary of successful and failed operations is displayed at the end
8. The script returns appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Previous Stories

**Story 1.1 Completion:**
- ✅ Base script structure with `validate_mkvmerge()` function
- ✅ Configuration loading with proper defaults
- ✅ `run_command()` function for subprocess execution
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing
- Current validation: Returns tuple (success, path, version) but doesn't halt script

**Story 1.2 Completion:**
- ✅ `embed_subtitle_pair()` returns (success, output_file, error_message)
- ✅ `validate_file_pair()` provides comprehensive file/permission validation
- ✅ `build_mkvmerge_command()` raises FileNotFoundError if mkvmerge missing
- Current behavior: Individual function errors, but no batch processing or summary reporting

**Key Learnings:**
- Windows subprocess patterns working correctly (list-based arguments)
- Error tuple pattern established: (success, result, error_message)
- FileNotFoundError used for fatal mkvmerge validation failures
- Integration test confirmed end-to-end reliability

### Error Handling Architecture

**Error Handling Strategy:**

This story focuses on **resilient batch processing** and **clear user feedback**. The architecture follows these principles:

1. **Fail Fast for Fatal Errors**: If mkvmerge is not available, exit immediately (AC: 1, 2)
2. **Fail Soft for Individual Errors**: Continue processing remaining files if one fails (AC: 5)
3. **Clear Error Context**: Every error includes the affected filename and specific problem (AC: 6)
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Summary at end shows success/failure counts and details (AC: 7)
5. **Semantic Exit Codes**: Different codes for different failure types (AC: 8)

[Source: architecture/architecture-document-subtitle-renamer-tool-ar-subtitle-embedding-feature.md#1.3-architectural-and-design-patterns]

### Current Error Handling State

**Already Implemented (from Stories 1.1, 1.2):**

From `validate_mkvmerge()`:
```python
# Returns: (success, resolved_path, version_info)
# - (False, None, None) if mkvmerge not found
# - (False, path, None) if found but not executable
# - (True, path, version) if successful
```

From `validate_file_pair()`:
```python
# Returns: (success, error_message)
# Checks: file existence, extensions, read/write permissions
# Error messages include specific file and problem
```

From `embed_subtitle_pair()`:
```python
# Returns: (success, output_file, error_message)
# Uses validate_file_pair() before processing
# Catches FileNotFoundError from build_mkvmerge_command()
# Executes mkvmerge and returns result status
```

From `run_command()`:
```python
# Returns: (success, stdout, stderr)
# Handles subprocess.TimeoutExpired
# Catches general exceptions
# 5-minute timeout for mkvmerge operations
```

**What's Missing (This Story's Scope):**

1. **Early mkvmerge Validation**: Currently checked per-file, needs upfront check before batch processing
2. **Batch Processing Loop**: No main loop exists yet (stub `find_matching_files()` returns empty list)
3. **Result Tracking**: No structure to track multiple operation results
4. **Operation Summary**: No function to display success/failure summary
5. **Exit Code Logic**: No explicit exit code handling based on operation results
6. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Need user-friendly translations of mkvmerge technical errors

### Exit Code Convention

**Proposed Exit Code Schema:**

```python
EXIT_SUCCESS = 0           # All operations completed successfully
EXIT_FATAL_ERROR = 1       # Fatal error: mkvmerge not found, config invalid, etc.
EXIT_PARTIAL_FAILURE = 2   # Some operations failed, some succeeded
EXIT_COMPLETE_FAILURE = 3  # All operations attempted failed
```

**Exit Code Logic:**
```python
if mkvmerge_not_found or config_invalid:
    return EXIT_FATAL_ERROR
elif total_operations == 0:
    return EXIT_SUCCESS  # Nothing to do is not an error
elif failed_count == 0:
    return EXIT_SUCCESS  # All succeeded
elif failed_count == total_operations:
    return EXIT_COMPLETE_FAILURE  # All failed
else:
    return EXIT_PARTIAL_FAILURE  # Mixed results
```

### Operation Summary Format

**Console Output Format:**

```
================================================================================
OPERATION SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total Processed: 10
Successful: 8
Failed: 2

FAILURES:
  [1] video1.mkv + subtitle1.srt
      Error: Subtitle file not found: C:\path\to\subtitle1.srt
  
  [2] video2.mkv + subtitle2.ass
      Error: mkvmerge failed: Error: The file 'subtitle2.ass' is damaged

================================================================================
```

### Batch Processing Structure

**Main Loop Pattern:**

```python
def main():
    """Main entry point with error handling."""
    # 1. Load configuration
    config = load_config()
    
    # 2. EARLY VALIDATION: Check mkvmerge before processing
    success, mkvmerge_path, version = validate_mkvmerge(config.get('mkvmerge_path'))
    if not success:
        print("[ERROR] mkvmerge.exe not found...")
        return EXIT_FATAL_ERROR
    
    print(f"[INFO] Using {version}")
    
    # 3. Parse arguments
    args = parse_arguments()
    directory = Path(args.directory)
    
    # 4. Find matching files
    file_pairs = find_matching_files(directory)
    
    if not file_pairs:
        print("[INFO] No matching video-subtitle pairs found")
        return EXIT_SUCCESS
    
    # 5. Process each pair with result tracking
    results = []
    for video_file, subtitle_file in file_pairs:
        success, output, error = embed_subtitle_pair(video_file, subtitle_file, config)
        results.append({
            'video': video_file,
            'subtitle': subtitle_file,
            'success': success,
            'output': output,
            'error': error
        })
    
    # 6. Display operation summary
    print_operation_summary(results)
    
    # 7. Return appropriate exit code
    return determine_exit_code(results)
```

### Error Message Enhancement

**mkvmerge Error Translation:**

Common mkvmerge errors should be translated to user-friendly messages:

```python
def translate_mkvmerge_error(stderr):
    """
    Translate technical mkvmerge errors to user-friendly messages.
    
    Args:
        stderr (str): Error output from mkvmerge
    
    Returns:
        str: User-friendly error message
    """
    error_lower = stderr.lower()
    
    if 'damaged' in error_lower or 'corrupt' in error_lower:
        return "File appears to be damaged or corrupted"
    elif 'not found' in error_lower:
        return "File not found or path invalid"
    elif 'permission denied' in error_lower:
        return "Permission denied (check file/folder permissions)"
    elif 'not a valid' in error_lower or 'unknown format' in error_lower:
        return "Invalid or unsupported file format"
    elif 'already exists' in error_lower:
        return "Output file already exists"
    else:
        # Include original error for unexpected cases
        return f"mkvmerge error: {stderr[:200]}"  # Truncate long errors
```

### Integration Points

**Functions to Modify/Enhance:**

1. **`main()` function** (currently basic):
   - Add early mkvmerge validation
   - Implement batch processing loop
   - Add result tracking
   - Call operation summary
   - Return exit codes

2. **New Functions to Add:**
   - `print_operation_summary(results)` - Display summary with formatting
   - `determine_exit_code(results)` - Calculate appropriate exit code
   - `translate_mkvmerge_error(stderr)` - Optional: User-friendly error messages

3. **Existing Functions** (no changes needed):
   - `validate_mkvmerge()` - already provides validation
   - `validate_file_pair()` - already checks permissions
   - `embed_subtitle_pair()` - already returns error info
   - `run_command()` - already captures errors

### Success Criteria

This story is complete when:
1. ✅ mkvmerge is validated before any file processing begins
2. ✅ Clear, actionable error messages displayed for all failure types
3. ✅ Permission errors specifically identified and reported
4. ✅ Individual file failures don't stop batch processing
5. ✅ All errors include affected filename and problem description
6. ✅ Operation summary displays success/failure counts and details
7. ✅ Script returns appropriate exit codes for different scenarios
8. ✅ All error handling paths tested (unit and integration tests)

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required

1. **Test Early mkvmerge Validation**
   - Mock `validate_mkvmerge()` to return failure
   - Verify script exits with code 1
   - Verify appropriate error message displayed

2. **Test Batch Processing with Failures**
   - Mock `find_matching_files()` to return multiple pairs
   - Mock some `embed_subtitle_pair()` calls to fail
   - Verify processing continues for all pairs
   - Verify result tracking captures all outcomes

3. **Test Operation Summary Display**
   - Create various result scenarios (all success, all fail, mixed)
   - Verify summary output format
   - Verify failure details are included

4. **Test Exit Code Logic**
   - Test EXIT_SUCCESS scenario (all succeeded)
   - Test EXIT_FATAL_ERROR scenario (mkvmerge not found)
   - Test EXIT_PARTIAL_FAILURE scenario (mixed results)
   - Test EXIT_COMPLETE_FAILURE scenario (all failed)

5. **Test Error Message Enhancement** (optional)
   - Test translation of common mkvmerge errors
   - Verify original error preserved for unknown errors

### Integration Tests Required

1. **Test Real Batch Processing**
   - Create multiple test file pairs (some valid, some invalid)
   - Run script and verify partial success handling
   - Verify summary and exit codes

### Testing Standards

- **Test File Location**: `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/test_embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`
- **Testing Framework**: Python `unittest` with `unittest.mock` for mocking
- **Test Naming**: `test_[function_name]_[scenario]` format
- **Mock Usage**: Use `@patch` decorators and `patch.object()` for proper isolation
- **Test Independence**: Each test must be independent and repeatable

### Files Modified During Review

None - no code changes required during review.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-error-handling-and-validation.yml

**Quality Score: 90/100**

**Issue Identified:**
- TEST-001 (Medium): Missing integration test for batch processing with multiple real files
- Current: Only unit tests with mocking + single-file integration test from Story 1.2
- Needed: Integration test with 2-3 real file pairs to verify batch processing end-to-end

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Recommended: Add batch integration test before marking Done**

All 8 acceptance criteria are functionally implemented and unit tested. However, the batch processing feature (the core of Story 1.3) has not been integration tested with real files. 

**Options:**
1. **Add integration test** - Recommended to prove batch processing works end-to-end
2. **Accept risk and mark Done** - Unit tests verify logic, accept that batch mode isn't integration tested
3. **Test manually** - Run script with multiple files, verify behavior, document results

---

**Strong implementation** with one testing recommendation:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Resilient batch processing logic
- ✅ Clear user feedback
- ✅ Semantic exit codes
- ✅ Good unit test coverage (11 tests)
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code

**Recommendation:**
- ⚠️ Add integration test with multiple real files to verify batch processing works end-to-end before production deployment
