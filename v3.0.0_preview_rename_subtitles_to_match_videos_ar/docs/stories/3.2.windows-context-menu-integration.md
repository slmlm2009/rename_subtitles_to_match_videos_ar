# Story 3.2: Add Windows Context Menu Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Windows user,  
**I want** to embed subtitles by right-clicking empty space inside a folder containing the video and subtitle files, then clicking "Embed subtitles"  
**so that** I can quickly process files without opening a terminal.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A registry file `add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` is created
2. Running the registry file adds "Embed subtitles" to the context menu as in the referenced existing `add_rename_subtitle_menu.reg`
3. The context menu entry executes `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` with the folder path
4. The script and `mkvmerge.exe` are assumed to be in `C:\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\`
5. A console window appears during processing to show progress
6. A companion registry file `remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` is created for uninstallation
7. The registry integration works on Windows 10 and Windows 11

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 3.1 - Configuration File Handling]

**Key Learnings from Previous Story:**
- Configuration loading is well-established pattern (load_config function)
- Integration tests are preferred over unit tests for user-facing functionality
- Both scripts (embedding and renaming) share common patterns and should maintain consistency
- Existing registry file pattern is already established in `add_subtitle_rename_menu.reg`

### Windows Registry Integration Context

[Source: Architecture Document §2 - Tech Stack, §6 - Infrastructure and Deployment]

**Windows Registry Basics:**
- Registry files use `.reg` extension and follow specific syntax
- Registry Editor Version 5.00 header required
- Backslashes must be escaped (\\) in registry paths
- Registry modifications require administrator privileges when executed

**Existing Registry File Pattern:**
The project already has context menu integration for the renaming script:
- File: `add_subtitle_rename_menu.reg` (installation)
- File: `remove_subtitle_rename_menu.reg` (uninstallation)
- Location: `C:\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\`
- Icon: `ARAB_STREAMS_LOGO.ico`

**Registry Key Structure for Folder Context Menu:**
```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\[Menu Item Name]
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\[Menu Item Name]\command
```

### File Structure and Locations

[Source: Architecture Document §5 - Source Tree]

**Target Deployment Location:**
```
C:/rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/
├── embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py
├── add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg          ← NEW FILE (this story)
├── remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg       ← NEW FILE (this story)
├── mkvmerge.exe
├── rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py
├── add_subtitle_rename_menu.reg         ← EXISTING (pattern reference)
├── remove_subtitle_rename_menu.reg      ← EXISTING (pattern reference)
├── ARAB_STREAMS_LOGO.ico
└── config.ini
```

**Files to Create:**
1. `add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` - Adds context menu entry
2. `remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` - Removes context menu entry

### Registry File Specifications

[Source: Architecture Document §2.1 - Windows Subprocess Execution Guidelines, §6 - Infrastructure and Deployment]

**Installation Registry File (`add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg`):**
- Menu item name: "Embed subtitles"
- Icon path: `C:\\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\\ARAB_STREAMS_LOGO.ico`
- Command: `C:\\Windows\\py.exe` (Python launcher)
- Script path: `C:\\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\\embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`
- Argument: `%V` (folder path clicked by user)

**Uninstallation Registry File (`remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg`):**
- Deletes the registry key created by installation file
- Uses minus sign (-) prefix before key to delete

**Command Execution Pattern:**
The registry command must:
1. Use the Windows Python launcher (`py.exe`) for compatibility
2. Pass the folder path using `%V` special variable
3. Use escaped backslashes in all Windows paths
4. Quote all path arguments to handle spaces

### Python Script Compatibility

[Source: embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py, Architecture Document §2.1]

**Current Script Execution:**
- Script already accepts directory path as command-line argument
- Uses `argparse` for argument parsing
- Supports folder path input via `sys.argv`
- Console window appears automatically when executed

**No Code Changes Required:**
The embedding script is already designed to:
- Accept a directory path as its first argument
- Display progress output to console
- Keep console window open on errors (smart console behavior from Story 3.3)
- Work when executed from Windows context menu

### Testing Approach

[Source: Story 3.1 - Testing Section]

**Manual Testing Required:**
- Registry integration requires manual testing on actual Windows system
- Test scenarios:
  1. Install registry entry (run add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg as admin)
  2. Verify "Embed subtitles" appears in folder right-click menu
  3. Execute from context menu on test folder
  4. Verify console window appears and script executes correctly
  5. Uninstall registry entry (run remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg as admin)
  6. Verify context menu entry is removed

**Compatibility Testing:**
- Test on Windows 10
- Test on Windows 11 (if available)

**No Automated Tests:**
Registry integration cannot be effectively unit tested. Manual verification required.

### Icon Asset

[Source: Architecture Document §5 - Source Tree]

**Icon File:**
- File: `ARAB_STREAMS_LOGO.ico`
- Location: `C:\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\`
- Already exists in project (shared with renaming script)
- Size: 61,055 bytes (verified in project structure)

### Documentation Requirements

**Files to Update:**
- `CONFIGURATION_README.md` - Add section about context menu installation
- Include screenshots or clear instructions for:
  - How to run .reg files as administrator
  - Where to find the context menu option
  - How to uninstall if needed

### Potential Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: Permission Denied**
- Cause: Registry modifications require admin privileges
- Solution: Documentation must emphasize "Run as administrator"

**Issue 2: Python Not in PATH**
- Cause: User doesn't have Python launcher
- Solution: Use `C:\\Windows\\py.exe` which is installed with Python by default

**Issue 3: Wrong Folder Path**
- Cause: Using %1 instead of %V in registry
- Solution: Use %V which provides the directory path for folder background context menu

**Issue 4: Script Path Hardcoded**
- Cause: Registry assumes specific installation path
- Solution: Document that users must install to `C:\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\`

### Consistency with Existing Pattern

[Source: add_subtitle_rename_menu.reg]

**Pattern to Follow:**
The existing renaming script registry file should be used as the exact template:
```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\Rename subtitle files]
"Icon"="C:\\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\\ARAB_STREAMS_LOGO.ico"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\Rename subtitle files\command]
@="\"C:\\Windows\\py.exe\" \"C:\\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar\\rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py\" \"%V\""
```

**Changes Needed:**
1. Change "Rename subtitle files" to "Embed subtitles"
2. Change script name from `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` to `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`
3. Keep everything else identical (icon path, folder path, command structure)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Clean Installation**
- **Given:** Windows system with no previous context menu entry
- **When:** User runs `add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` as administrator
- **Then:** "Embed subtitles" appears in folder right-click menu with icon

**Scenario 2: Context Menu Execution**
- **Given:** Context menu entry is installed
- **When:** User right-clicks inside a folder and selects "Embed subtitles"
- **Then:** Console window appears and `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` executes with the folder path

**Scenario 3: Uninstallation**
- **Given:** Context menu entry is installed
- **When:** User runs `remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` as administrator
- **Then:** "Embed subtitles" option is removed from context menu

**Scenario 4: Reinstallation**
- **Given:** Context menu entry was previously removed
- **When:** User runs `add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` as administrator again
- **Then:** "Embed subtitles" appears in context menu again

**Scenario 5: Windows 11 Compatibility**
- **Given:** Windows 11 system
- **When:** Installation and execution steps are performed
- **Then:** Context menu works identically to Windows 10

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Registry files are valid and can be executed
- [ ] Context menu entry appears with correct name and icon
- [ ] Script executes when context menu option is selected
- [ ] Console window appears during script execution
- [ ] Uninstallation removes context menu entry cleanly
- [ ] Works on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 (if tested)
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Draft: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Scrum Master Bob)
- Implementation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Developer James)

### Debug Log References

**Task 1-2: Registry File Creation**
- Created `add_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` following existing pattern from `add_subtitle_rename_menu.reg`
- Created `remove_embed_subtitle_menu.reg` following existing pattern from `remove_subtitle_rename_menu.reg`
- Verified all backslashes escaped (\\) and paths quoted correctly

**Task 4: Documentation Update**
- Added comprehensive Windows Context Menu Integration section to `CONFIGURATION_README.md`
- Included installation, usage, uninstallation, and troubleshooting instructions
- Documented both renaming and embedding context menu options

**Task 5: Script Compatibility Verification**
- Reviewed `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` argparse implementation
- Confirmed script accepts directory path as first positional argument
- Confirmed console window appears automatically during execution
- No code changes required - script already fully compatible

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary:**
All tasks completed successfully. Created two registry files for Windows context menu integration following the established pattern from the renaming script. Updated documentation with comprehensive instructions for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

**Pattern Consistency:**
Registry files follow exact same structure as existing `add_subtitle_rename_menu.reg` and `remove_subtitle_rename_menu.reg`, with only the menu item name and script path changed:
- Menu item: "Rename subtitle files" → "Embed subtitles"
- Script: `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` → `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`

**No Code Changes:**
Verified that `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` already accepts directory path as argument via argparse, making it fully compatible with Windows context menu execution. No Python code modifications were needed.

**Manual Testing:**
Task 3 requires manual testing on actual Windows system with administrator privileges. Registry installation cannot be automated or unit tested. Documentation provides clear testing scenarios for user verification.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Existing pattern files provide excellent template for consistency
- Registry integration is straightforward when following established patterns
- Documentation is critical for registry modifications requiring admin privileges
- Script was already designed with context menu integration in mind
