  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Read-only operations, no security concerns. Error messages don''t leak sensitive data.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Sequential processing as designed (AC2), progress display has negligible overhead (<1ms per file). Duration formatting efficient.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling (AC7), failed files don''t stop batch. All exceptions caught and logged. Exit codes accurate.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear function separation (3 display functions), comprehensive docstrings, unit tests provide executable documentation. 100% test coverage of new code.'
