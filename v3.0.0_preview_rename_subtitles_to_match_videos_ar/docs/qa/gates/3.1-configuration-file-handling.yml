nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Config validation prevents critical errors. No hardcoded secrets. Proper error handling.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Config loading is one-time at startup. No performance impact on processing.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust fallback behavior. Only critical errors (missing mkvmerge) stop execution. All other invalid values use safe defaults.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Well-documented functions with clear docstrings. 3-tier detection logic is straightforward. Config structure is extensible.'

strengths:
  - 'Excellent fallback behavior - prioritizes reliability over perfection'
  - '3-tier language detection strategy is clear and well-implemented'
  - 'Integration tests validate real-world usage with mkvmerge'
  - 'Both embedding and renaming scripts updated for consistency'
  - 'Backward compatible - all 43 existing tests pass'
